ðŸŽ¯ AP. Filtering and Organizing Render Tasks

Task Objective

In this task, you will:

Work with a list of tuples representing shot names and their frame counts.

Apply list comprehension to filter out specific shots based on frame count.

Apply dictionary comprehension to map shot names to their estimated render times.

Print the results to verify your solution.

Instructions

Create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (shot_name, frame_count).

Use a list comprehension to extract only the shots that have more than 100 frames.

Use a dictionary comprehension to calculate the render time for each shot (frame count Ã— 0.5 minutes).

Print the filtered list of shot names.

Print the dictionary showing the estimated render times.

Sample Output

Shots with more than 100 frames:
['shot002', 'shot004']

Estimated Render Times (in minutes):
{'shot001': 30.0, 'shot002': 170.0, 'shot003': 45.0, 'shot004': 120.0}
