ðŸŽ¯ AP. Extracting & Mapping Asset Information

Task Objective

In this task, you will:

Work with a list of asset data stored as tuples (asset_name, asset_type).

Use list comprehension to filter out only the assets of type "character".

Use dictionary comprehension to map each asset name to the length of its name.

Print the results to verify your solution.

Instructions

Create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (asset_name, asset_type).

Use a list comprehension to filter only the assets of type "character".

Use a dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary mapping each asset name to the number of characters in the name.

Print the filtered list of character assets.

Print the dictionary mapping asset names to their lengths.

Sample Output

Character Assets:
['dragon', 'warrior']

Asset Name Lengths:
{'tree': 4, 'car': 3, 'dragon': 6, 'warrior': 7}
